# Appendix C - DOS command-line utilities

There are three DOS command-line utilities found in the TraceX installation under the ***Utilities*** subdirectory.

The utilities supplied are listed below:

| **Utility**				               | **Purpose**                               | **Command-Line Definitions** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **ea2tracex.exe**                | Converts the trace file ea2tracex generated by ThreadX in original_file association with the GHS tools converted_file to the TraceX trace file format. The ThreadX for GHS tools produces a different trace format than ThreadX for non-GHS tools, which is why this conversion utility is needed. | ``` > eatracex original_file converted_file <cr> ``` | 
**hex2tracex.exe** | Converts a trace file generated by ThreadX but dumped from the development tool in Intel HEX format to the binary TraceX trace file format. TraceX V5 and above can open HEX files without converting them. | ``` hex2tracex hex_file converted_file <cr> ``` | 
**mot2tracex.exe** | Converts a trace file generated by ThreadX but dumped from the development tool in  Motorola S-Record format to the binary TraceX trace file format. TraceX V5 and above can open S-Record files without converting them. | ``` > mot2tracex mot_file converted_file <cr> ```|
