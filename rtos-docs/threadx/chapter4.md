# Chapter 4 - Description of ThreadX Services

This chapter contains a description of all ThreadX services in alphabetic order. Their names are designed so all similar services are grouped together. In the **Return Values** section in the following descriptions, values in **BOLD** are not affected by the **TX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING** define used to disable API error checking; while values shown in nonbold are completely disabled. In addition, a "**Yes**" listed under the "**Preemption Possible**" heading indicates that calling the service may resume a higher-priority thread, thus preempting the calling thread.

The Threadx API functions available to the application are as follows.

## tx_block_allocate

Allocate fixed-size block of memory

### Prototype

```c
UINT tx_block_allocate(
    TX_BLOCK_POOL *pool_ptr, 
    VOID **block_ptr,
    ULONG wait_option);
```

### Description

This service allocates a fixed-size memory block from the specified memory pool. The actual size of the memory block is determined during memory pool creation.

> **Important:** *It is important to ensure application code does not write outside the allocated memory block. If this happens, corruption occurs in an adjacent (usually subsequent) memory block. The results are unpredictable and often fatal!*

### Parameters

- *pool_ptr*: <br>Pointer to a previously created memory block pool.
- *block_ptr*: <br>Pointer to a destination block pointer. On successful allocation, the address of the allocated memory block is placed where this parameter points.
- *wait_option*: <br>Defines how the service behaves if there are no memory blocks available. The wait options are defined as follows:
  - **TX_NO_WAIT** (0x00000000) - Selecting **TX_NO_WAIT** results in an immediate return from this service regardless if it was successful or not. *This is the only valid option if the service is called from a non-thread; e.g., Initialization, timer, or ISR*.
  - **TX_WAIT_FOREVER** (0xFFFFFFF) - Selecting **TX_WAIT_FOREVER** causes the calling thread to suspend indefinitely until a memory block is available.
  - *timeout value* (0x00000001 through 0xFFFFFFFE) - Selecting a numeric value (1-0xFFFFFFFE) specifies the maximum number of timer-ticks to stay suspended while waiting for a memory block.

### Return Values

- **TX_SUCCESS**	(0x00)	Successful memory block allocation.
- **TX_DELETED**	(0x01)	Memory block pool was deleted while thread was suspended.
- **TX_NO_MEMORY**	(0x10)	Service was unable to allocate a block of memory within the specified time to wait.
- **TX_WAIT_ABORTED**	(0x1A)	Suspension was aborted by another thread, timer or ISR.
- **TX_POOL_ERROR**	(0x02)	Invalid memory block pool pointer.
- **TX_WAIT_ERROR**	(0x04)	A wait option other than TX_NO_WAIT was specified on a call from a nonthread.
- **TX_PTR_ERROR**	(0x03)	Invalid pointer to destination pointer.

### Allowed From

Initialization, threads, timers, and ISRs

### Preemption Possible

Yes

### Example

```c
TX_BLOCK_POOL my_pool;
unsigned char *memory_ptr;

UINT status;

/* Allocate a memory block from my_pool. Assume that the pool has
already been created with a call to tx_block_pool_create. */

status = tx_block_allocate(&my_pool, (VOID **) &memory_ptr,
  TX_NO_WAIT);

/* If status equals TX_SUCCESS, memory_ptr contains the address of
the allocated block of memory. */
```

    TX_BLOCK_POOL pool_ptr,
    CHAR name_ptr, 
    ULONG block_size,
    VOID pool_start, 
    ULONG pool_size);
```

### Description

This service creates a pool of fixed-size memory blocks. The memory area specified is divided into as many fixed-size memory blocks as possible using the formula:

**total blocks** = (**total bytes**) /
(**block size** + sizeof(void *))

> **Note:** *Each memory block contains one pointer of overhead that is invisible to the user and is represented by the "sizeof(void *)" in the preceding formula.*

### Parameters

- **pool_ptr**: Pointer to a memory block pool control block.
- **name_ptr**: Pointer to the name of the memory block pool.
- **block_size**: Number of bytes in each memory block.
- **pool_start**: Starting address of the memory block pool. The starting address must be aligned to the size of the ULONG data type..
- **pool_size**: Total number of bytes available for the memory block pool.

### Return Values

- **TX_SUCCESS**	(0x00)	Successful memory block pool creation.
- **TX_POOL_ERROR**	(0x02)	Invalid memory block pool pointer. Either the pointer is NULL or the pool is already created.
- **TX_PTR_ERROR**	(0x03)	Invalid starting address of the pool.
- **TX_CALLER_ERROR**	(0x13)	Invalid caller of this service.
- **TX_SIZE_ERROR**	(0x05)	Size of pool is invalid.

### Allowed From

Initialization and threads

### Preemption Possible

No

### Example

```c
TX_BLOCK_POOL my_pool;

UINT status;

/* Create a memory pool whose total size is 1000 bytes starting at
address 0x100000. Each block in this pool is defined to be 50 bytes
long. */
status = tx_block_pool_create(&my_pool, "my_pool_name",
  50, (VOID *) 0x100000, 1000);

/* If status equals TX_SUCCESS, my_pool contains 18 memory blocks
of 50 bytes each. The reason there are not 20 blocks in the pool is
because of the one overhead pointer associated with each block. */
```

    VOID **memory_ptr, 
    ULONG memory_size,
    ULONG wait_option);
```

### Description

This service allocates the specified number of bytes from the specified memory byte pool.

> **Important:** *It is important to ensure application code does not write outside the allocated memory block. If this happens, corruption occurs in an adjacent (usually subsequent) memory block. The results are unpredictable and often fatal!*

> **Note:** *The performance of this service is a function of the block size and the amount of fragmentation in the pool. Hence, this service should not be used during time-critical threads of execution.*

### Parameters

- **pool_ptr**: Pointer to a previously created memory pool.
- **memory_ptr**: Pointer to a destination memory pointer. On successful allocation, the address of the allocated memory area is placed where this parameter points to.
- **memory_size**: Number of bytes requested.
- **wait_option**: Defines how the service behaves if there is not enough memory available. The wait options are defined as follows:
    - **TX_NO_WAIT**: (0x00000000)
    - **TX_WAIT_FOREVER**: (0xFFFFFFFF)
    - timeout value: (0x00000001 through 0xFFFFFFFE)

    Selecting TX_NO_WAIT results in an immediate return from this service regardless of whether or not it was successful. *This is the only valid option if the service is called from initialization.*

    Selecting TX_WAIT_FOREVER causes the calling thread to suspend indefinitely until enough memory is available.

    Selecting a numeric value (1-0xFFFFFFFE) specifies the maximum number of timer-ticks to stay suspended while waiting for the memory.

### Return Values

- **TX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful memory allocation.
- **TX_DELETED** (0x01) Memory pool was deleted while thread was suspended.
- **TX_NO_MEMORY** (0x10) Service was unable to allocate the memory within the specified time to wait.

- **TX_POOL_ERROR** (0x02) Invalid memory pool pointer.
- **TX_PTR_ERROR** (0x03) Invalid pointer to destination pointer.
- **TX_SIZE_ERROR** (0X05) Requested size is zero or larger than the pool.
- **TX_WAIT_ERROR** (0x04) A wait option other than TX_NO_WAIT was specified on a call from a nonthread.
- **TX_CALLER_ERROR** (0x13) Invalid caller of this service.

### Allowed From

Initialization and threads

### Preemption Possible

Yes

### Example
```c
TX_BYTE_POOL my_pool;

    ULONG requested_flags, 
    UINT get_option,
    ULONG *actual_flags_ptr, 
    ULONG wait_option);
```

### Description

This service retrieves event flags from the specified event flags group. Each event flags group contains 32 event flags. Each flag is represented by a single bit. This service can retrieve a variety of event flag combinations, as selected by the input parameters.

### Parameters

- *group_ptr*: <br>Pointer to a previously created event flags group.
- *requested_flags*: <br>32-bit unsigned variable that represents the requested event flags.
- *get_option*: <br>Specifies whether all or any of the requested event flags are required. The following are valid selections:

  - **TX_AND_CLEAR** (0x03)
  - **TX_OR** (0x00)
  - **TX_OR_CLEAR** (0x01)

    Selecting TX_AND or TX_AND_CLEAR specifies that all event flags must be present in the group. Selecting TX_OR or TX_OR_CLEAR     specifies that any event flag is satisfactory. Event flags that satisfy the request are cleared (set to zero) if TX_AND_CLEAR or TX_OR_CLEAR are specified.

- *actual_flags_ptr*: <br>Pointer to destination of where the retrieved event flags are placed. Note that the actual flags obtained may contain flags that were not requested.
- *wait_option*:  <br>Defines how the service behaves if the selected event flags are not set. The wait options are defined as follows:
  - **TX_NO_WAIT** (0x00000000) - Selecting TX_NO_WAIT results in an immediate return from this service regardless of whether or not it was successful. This is the only valid option if the service is called from a non-thread; e.g., Initialization, timer, or ISR.
  - **TX_WAIT_FOREVER** timeout value  (0xFFFFFFFF) - Selecting TX_WAIT_FOREVER causes the calling thread to suspend indefinitely until the event flags are available.

### Return Values

- **TX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful event flags get.
- **TX_DELETED** (0x01) Event flags group was deleted while thread was suspended.
- **TX_NO_EVENTS** (0x07) Service was unable to get the specified events within the specified time to wait.
- **TX_WAIT_ABORTED** (0x1A) Suspension was aborted by another thread, timer, or ISR.
- **TX_GROUP_ERROR** (0x06) Invalid event flags group pointer.
- **TX_PTR_ERROR** (0x03) Invalid pointer for actual event flags.
- **TX_WAIT_ERROR** (0x04) A wait option other than TX_NO_WAIT was specified on a call from a nonthread.
- **TX_OPTION_ERROR** (0x08) Invalid get-option was specified.

### Allowed From

  - **TX_WAIT_FOREVER** (0xFFFFFFFF) - Selecting TX_WAIT_FOREVER causes the calling thread to suspend indefinitely until a semaphore instance is available.
  - timeout value (0x00000001 through 0xFFFFFFFE) - Selecting a numeric value (1-0xFFFFFFFE) specifies the maximum number of timer-ticks to stay suspended while waiting for a semaphore instance.

### Return Values

- **TX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful retrieval of a semaphore instance.
- **TX_DELETED** (0x01) Counting semaphore was deleted while thread was suspended.
- **TX_NO_INSTANCE** (0x0D) Service was unable to retrieve an instance of the counting semaphore (semaphore count is zero within the specified time to wait).
- **TX_WAIT_ABORTED** (0x1A) Suspension was aborted by another thread, timer, or ISR.
- **TX_SEMAPHORE_ERROR** (0x0C) Invalid counting semaphore pointer.
- **TX_WAIT_ERROR** (0x04) A wait option other than TX_NO_WAIT was specified on a call from a non-thread.

### Allowed From

Initialization, threads, timers, and ISRs

### Preemption Possible

Yes

### Example

```c
TX_SEMAPHORE my_semaphore;
UINT status;

/* Get a semaphore instance from the semaphore
"my_semaphore." If the semaphore count is zero,
suspend until an instance becomes available.
Note that this suspension is only possible from
application threads. */

## tx_thread_create

Create application thread

### Prototype

```c
UINT tx_thread_create(
    TX_THREAD *thread_ptr,
    CHAR *name_ptr, 
    VOID (*entry_function)(ULONG),
    ULONG entry_input, 
    VOID *stack_start,
    ULONG stack_size, 
    UINT priority,
    UINT preempt_threshold, 
    ULONG time_slice,
    UINT auto_start);
```

### Description

This service creates an application thread that starts execution at the specified task entry function. The stack, priority, preemption-threshold, and time-slice are among the attributes specified by the input parameters. In addition, the initial execution state of the thread is also specified.

### Parameters

- *thread_ptr*: Pointer to a thread control block.
- *name_ptr*: Pointer to the name of the thread.
- *entry_function*: Specifies the initial C function for thread execution. When a thread returns from this entry function, it is placed in a *completed* state and suspended indefinitely.
- *entry_input*: A 32-bit value that is passed to the thread's entry function when it first executes. The use for this input is determined exclusively by the application.
- *stack_start*: Starting address of the stack's memory area.
- *stack_size*: Number bytes in the stack memory area. The thread's stack area must be large enough to handle its worst-case function call nesting and local variable usage.
- *priority*: Numerical priority of thread. Legal values range from 0 through (TX_MAX_PRIORITIES-1), where a value of 0 represents the highest priority.
- *preempt_threshold*: Highest priority level (0 through (TX_MAX_PRIORITIES-1)) of disabled preemption. Only priorities higher than this level are allowed to preempt this thread. This value must be less than or equal to the specified priority. A value equal to the thread priority disables preemption-threshold.
- *time_slice*: Number of timer-ticks this thread is allowed to run before other ready threads of the same priority are given a chance to run. Note that using preemption-threshold disables time-slicing. Legal time-slice values range from 1 to 0xFFFFFFFF (inclusive). A value of **TX_NO_TIME_SLICE** (a value of 0) disables time-slicing of this thread.

  > **Note:** *Using time-slicing results in a slight amount of system overhead.   Since time-slicing is only useful in cases where multiple threads   share the same priority, threads having a unique priority should not   be assigned a time-slice.*

- *auto_start*: Specifies whether the thread starts immediately or is placed in a suspended state. Legal options are **TX_AUTO_START** (0x01) and **TX_DONT_START** (0x00). If TX_DONT_START is specified, the application must later call tx_thread_resume in order for the thread to run.

### Return Values

- **TX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful thread creation.
- **TX_THREAD_ERROR** (0x0E) Invalid thread control pointer. Either the pointer is NULL or the thread is already created.
- **TX_PTR_ERROR** (0x03) Invalid starting address of the entry point or the stack area is invalid, usually NULL.
- **TX_SIZE_ERROR** (0x05) Size of stack area is invalid. Threads must have at least **TX_MINIMUM_STACK** bytes to execute.
- **TX_PRIORITY_ERROR** (0x0F) Invalid thread priority, which is a value outside the range of (0 through (TX_MAX_PRIORITIES-1)).
- **TX_THRESH_ERROR** (0x18) Invalid preemption threshold specified. This value must be a valid priority less than or equal to the initial priority of the thread.
- **TX_START_ERROR** (0x10) Invalid auto-start selection.
- **TX_CALLER_ERROR** (0x13) Invalid caller of this service.

### Allowed From

Initialization and threads

### Preemption Possible

Yes

### Example

```c
TX_THREAD my_thread;
UINT status;

/* Create a thread of priority 15 whose entry point is
"my_thread_entry". This thread's stack area is 1000
bytes in size, starting at address 0x400000. The
preemption-threshold is setup to allow preemption of threads
with priorities ranging from 0 through 14. Time-slicing is
disabled. This thread is automatically put into a ready
condition. */
status = tx_thread_create(&my_thread, "my_thread_name",
    my_thread_entry, 0x1234,
    (VOID *) 0x400000, 1000,
    15, 15, TX_NO_TIME_SLICE,
    TX_AUTO_START);

/* If status equals TX_SUCCESS, my_thread is ready
for execution! */

...

/* Thread's entry function. When "my_thread" actually
begins execution, control is transferred to this
function. */

VOID my_thread_entry (ULONG initial_input)
{
    /* When we get here, the value of initial_input is
    0x1234. See how this was specified during
    creation. */

In this case, a subsequent ***tx_timer_activate*** service call is necessary to get the timer actually started.

### Return Values

- **TX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful application timer creation.
- **TX_TIMER_ERROR** (0x15) Invalid application timer pointer. Either the pointer is NULL or the timer is already created.
- **TX_TICK_ERROR** (0x16) Invalid value (a zero) supplied for initial ticks.
- **TX_ACTIVATE_ERROR** (0x17) Invalid activation selected.
- **TX_CALLER_ERROR** (0x13) Invalid caller of this service.

### Allowed From

Initialization and threads

### Preemption Possible

No

### Example

```c
TX_TIMER my_timer;
UINT status;

/* Create an application timer that executes
"my_timer_function" after 100 ticks initially and then
after every 25 ticks. This timer is specified to start
immediately! */
status = tx_timer_create(&my_timer,"my_timer_name",
    my_timer_function, 0x1234, 100, 25,
    TX_AUTO_ACTIVATE);

/* If status equals TX_SUCCESS, my_timer_function will
be called 100 timer ticks later and then called every
25 timer ticks. Note that the value 0x1234 is passed to
my_timer_function every time it is called. */

## tx_timer_info_get

Retrieve information about an application timer

### Prototype

```c
UINT tx_timer_info_get(
    TX_TIMER *timer_ptr, 
    CHAR **name,
    UINT *active,
    ULONG *remaining_ticks,
    ULONG *reschedule_ticks,
    TX_TIMER **next_timer);
```

### Description

This service retrieves information about the specified application timer.

### Parameters

- *timer_ptr*: Pointer to a previously created application timer.
- *name*: Pointer to destination for the pointer to the timer's name.
- *active*: Pointer to destination for the timer active indication. If the timer is inactive or this service is called from the timer itself, a **TX_FALSE** value is returned. Otherwise, if the timer is active, a **TX_TRUE** value is returned.
- *remaining_ticks*: Pointer to destination for the number of timer ticks left before the timer expires.
- *reschedule_ticks*: Pointer to destination for the number of timer ticks that will be used to automatically reschedule this timer. If the value is zero, then the timer is a one-shot and won't be rescheduled.
- *next_timer*: Pointer to destination for the pointer of the next created application timer.

> **Note:** *Supplying a **TX_NULL** for any parameter indicates that the parameter is not required.*

### Return Values

- **TX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful timer information retrieval.
- **TX_TIMER_ERROR** (0x15) Invalid application timer pointer.

### Allowed From

Initialization, threads, timers, and ISRs

### Preemption Possible

### Example

```c
TX_TIMER my_timer;
CHAR *name;
UINT active;
ULONG remaining_ticks;
ULONG reschedule_ticks;
TX_TIMER *next_timer;
UINT status;

/* Retrieve information about the previously created
application timer "my_timer." */
status = tx_timer_info_get(&my_timer, &name,
    &active,&remaining_ticks,
    &reschedule_ticks,
    &next_timer);

/* If status equals TX_SUCCESS, the information requested is
valid. */
