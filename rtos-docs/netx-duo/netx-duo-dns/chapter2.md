# Chapter 2 - Installation and Use of NetX Duo DNS Client

This chapter contains a description of various issues related to installation, setup, and usage of the NetX Duo DNS Client.

## Product Distribution

NetX Duo DNS Client is available at [https://github.com/azure-rtos/netxduo](https://github.com/azure-rtos/netxduo). The package includes two source files and a PDF file that contains this document, as follows:

- **nxd_dns.h** Header file for NetX Duo DNS Client
- **nxd_dns.c** C Source file for NetX Duo DNS Client
- **nxd_dns.pdf** PDF description of NetX Duo DNS Client

## DNS Client Installation

To use NetX Duo DNS Client, copy the source code files *nxd_dns.c* and *nxd_dns.h* to the same directory where NetX Duo is installed. For example, if NetX Duo is installed in the directory "*\threadx\arm7\green*" then the *nxd_dns.h* and *nxd_dns.c* files should be copied into this directory.

## Using the DNS Client

Using NetX Duo DNS Client is easy. Basically, the application code must include *nxd_dns.h* after it includes *tx_api.h* and *nx_api.h*, in order to use ThreadX and NetX Duo, respectively. Once *nxd_dns.h* is included, the application code is then able to make the DNS function calls specified later in this guide. The application must also add *nxd_dns.c* to the build process. This file must be compiled in the same manner as other application files and its object form must be linked along with the files of the application. This is all that is required to use NetX Duo DNS.

> **Note:** Since DNS utilizes NetX Duo UDP services, UDP must be enabled with the *nx_udp_enable* call prior to using DNS.

## Small Example System for NetX Duo DNS Client 

NetX Duo DNS Client is compatible with existing NetX DNS applications. The list of legacy services and their NetX Duo equivalent is shown below:

| NetX DNS API service (IPv4 only) | NetX Duo DNS API service (IPv4 and IPv6 supported) |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| nx_dns_host_by_name_get          | nxd_dns_host_by_name_get                           |
| nx_dns_host_by_address_get       | nxd_dns_host_by_address_get                        |
| nx_dns_server_get                | nxd_dns_server_get                                 |
| nx_dns_server_add                | nxd_dns_server_add                                 |
| nx_dns_server_remove             | nxd_dns_server_remove                              |

See the description of NetX Duo DNS Client API services in Chapter 3 for more details.

In the example DNS application program provided in this section, *nxd_dns.h* is included at line 6. NX_DNS_CLIENT_USER_CREATE_PACKET_POOL, which allows the DNS Client application to create the packet pool for the DNS Client, is declared on lines 24-26. This packet pool is used for allocating packets for sending DNS messages. If NX_DNS_CLIENT_USER_CREATE_PACKET_POOL is defined, a packet pool is created in lines 78-98. If this option is not enabled, the DNS Client creates its own packet pool as per the packet payload and pool size set by configuration parameters in *nxd_dns.h* and described elsewhere in this chapter.

Another packet pool is created in lines 100-112 for the Client IP instance which is used for internal NetX Duo operations. Next the IP instance is created using the *nx_ip_create* call in line 115. It is possible for the IP task and the DNS Client to share the same packet pool, but since the DNS Client typically sends out larger messages than the control packets sent by the IP task, using separate packet pools makes more efficient use of memory.

ARP and UDP (which is used by IPv4 networks) are enabled in lines 129 and 141 respectively.

> **Note:** This demo uses the 'ram' driver declared on line 44 and used in the *nx_ip_create* call. This ram driver is distributed with the NetX Duo source code. To actually run the DNS Client the application must supply an actual physical network driver to transmit and receive packets from the DNS server.

The Client thread entry function *thread_client_entry* is defined below the *tx_application_define* function. It initially relinquishes control to the system to allow the IP task thread to be initialized by the network driver.

It then creates the DNS Client in line 257, initializes the DNS cache on lines 267- 278, and sets the packet pool previously created to the DNS Client instance on lines 281-295. It then adds DNS server on lines 297-341.

The remainder of the example program uses the DNS Client services to make DNS queries. Host IP address lookups are performed on lines 193 and 207. The difference between these two services, *nxd_dns_host_by_name_get* and *nx_dns_host_by_name_get*, is that the former saves the address data in an NXD_ADDRESS data type, while the latter saves the data in a ULONG data type. Further the latter is limited to IPv4 networks, while the former can be used with IPv6 or IPv4 networks. This is only possible if the IP instance is enabled for IPv6. See the NetX Duo User Guide for more details on enabling the IP instance for IPv6 networking.

Another service for host IP address lookups is shown on line 464, *nx_dns_ipv4_address_by_name_get*. This service differs from *nx_dns_host_by_name_get* in that it returns all (or as many will fit in the supplied buffer) of the IPv4 addresses discovered for the domain name, not just the first address received in the DNS Server reply.

Similarly, the *nxd_dns_ipv6_address_by_name_get* service, called on line 380, returns all the IPv6 addresses discovered by the DNS Client, not just the first one.

Reverse lookups (host name from IP address) are performed on lines 606 (*nx_dns_host_by_address_get*) and again on line 564 and 588 (*nxd_dns_host_by_address_get*). *nx_dns_host_by_address_get* will only work on IPv4 networks, while *nxd_dns_host_by_address_get* will work on either IPv4 or IPv6 networks (e.g. the IP instance is enabled for IPv6 as well as IPv4 networks).

Two more services for DNS lookups, CNAME and TXT, are demonstrated on lines 627 and 649 respectively, to discover CNAME and domain name data for the input domain name. NetX Duo DNS Client as similar services for other record types, e.g. MX, NS, SRV and SOA. See Chapter 3 for detailed descriptions of all record type lookups available in NetX Duo DNS Client.

When the DNS Client is deleted on line 846, using the *nx_dns_delete* service, the packet pool for the DNS Client is not deleted unless the DNS Client created its own packet pool. Otherwise, it is up to the application to delete the packet pool if it has no further use for it.

## Configuration Options

There are several configuration options for building DNS for NetX Duo. These options can be redefined in *nxd_dns.h.* The following list describes each in detail:  

- **NX_DNS_TYPE_OF_SERVICE** Type of service required for the DNS UDP requests. By default, this value is defined as NX_IP_NORMAL for normal IP packet service.

- **NX_DNS_TIME_TO_LIVE** Specifies the maximum number of routers a packet can pass before it is discarded. The default value is 0x80.

- **NX_DNS_FRAGMENT_OPTION** Sets the socket property to allow or disallow fragmentation of outgoing packets. The default value is NX_DONT_FRAGMENT.

- **NX_DNS_QUEUE_DEPTH** Sets the maximum number of packets to store on the socket receive queue. The default value is 5.

- **NX_DNS_MAX_SERVERS** Specifies the maximum number of DNS Servers in the Client server list. The default value is 5.

- **NX_DNS_MESSAGE_MAX** The maximum DNS message size for sending DNS queries. The default value is 512, which is also the maximum size specified in RFC 1035 Section 2.3.4.

- **NX_DNS_PACKET_PAYLOAD_UNALIGNED** If not defined, the size of the Client packet payload which includes the Ethernet, IP (or IPv6), and UDP headers plus the maximum DNS message size specified by NX_DNS_MESSAGE_MAX. Regardless if defined, the packet payload is the 4-byte aligned and stored in NX_DNS_PACKET_PAYLOAD.

- **NX_DNS_PACKET_POOL_SIZE** Size of the Client packet pool for sending DNS queries if NX_DNS_CLIENT_USER_CREATE_PACKET_POOL is not defined. The default value is large enough for 16 packets of payload size defined by NX_DNS_PACKET_PAYLOAD, and is 4-byte aligned.

- **NX_DNS_MAX_RETRIES** The maximum number of times the DNS Client will query the current DNS server before trying another server or aborting the DNS query. The default value is 3.

- **NX_DNS_MAX_RETRANS_TIMEOUT** The maximum retransmission timeout on a DNS query to a specific DNS server. The default value is 64 seconds (64 * NX_IP_PERIODIC_RATE).

- **NX_DNS_IP_GATEWAY_AND_DNS_SERVER** If defined and the Client IPv4 gateway address is non zero, the DNS Client sets the IPv4 gateway as the Client's primary DNS server. The default value is disabled.

- **NX_DNS_PACKET_ALLOCATE_TIMEOUT** This sets the timeout option for allocating a packet from the DNS client packet pool. The default value is 1 second (1*NX_IP_PERIODIC_RATE).

- **NX_DNS_CLIENT_USER_CREATE_PACKET_POOL** This enables the DNS Client to let the application create and set the DNS Client packet pool. By default this option is disabled, and the DNS Client creates its own packet pool in *nx_dns_create*.

- **NX_DNS_CLIENT_CLEAR_QUEUE** This enables the DNS Client to clear old DNS messages off the receive queue before sending a new query. Removing these packets from previous DNS queries prevents the DNS Client socket queue from overflowing and dropping valid packets.

- **NX_DNS_ENABLE_EXTENDED_RR_TYPES** This enables the DNS Client to query on additional DNS record types in (e.g. CNAME, NS, MX, SOA, SRV and TXT).

- **NX_DNS_CACHE_ENABLE** This enables the DNS Client to store the answer records into DNS cache.
