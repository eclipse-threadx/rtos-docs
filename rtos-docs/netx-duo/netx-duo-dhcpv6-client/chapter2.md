# Chapter 2 - Installation and use of NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client

This chapter contains a description of various issues related to installation, setup, and usage of the NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client component.

## Product Distribution

NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client is available at [https://github.comeclipse-threadx/netxduo](https://github.comeclipse-threadx/netxduo). The package includes two source files and a PDF file that contains this document, as follows:

- **nxd_dhcpv6_client.h** Header file for NetX DuoDHCPv6 Client

- **nxd_dhcpv6_client.c** Source code file for NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client

- **demo_netxduo_dhcpv6_client.c** Sample program demonstrating the setup of the NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client

- **nxd_dhcpv6_client.pdf** PDF description of NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client

## NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client Installation

To use NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client API, the entire distribution mentioned above can be copied to the same directory where NetX Duo is installed. For example, if NetX Duo is installed in the directory "*\threadx\arm7\green*" then the *nxd_dhcpv6_client.h* and *nxd_dhpcv6_client.c* files can be copied into this directory.

## Using the NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client

The application code must include *nxd_dhcpv6_client.h* after it includes *tx_api.h* and *nx_api.h*, to use DHCPv6 Client, ThreadX and NetX Duo services, respectively. *nxd_dhcpv6_client.c* must be compiled in the project in the same manner as other application files and its object form must be linked along with the files of the application.

### <span class="underline">Client DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID)</span>

The Client DUID uniquely defines each Client on a network. An application must create a Client DUID prior to requesting an IPv6 address from a Server. The Client DUID is automatically included in all messages to the Server. To create a DUID, the application calls the service *nx_dhcpv6_create_client_duid:*
```C
UINT nx_dhcpv6_create_client_duid(NX_DHCPV6 *dhcpv6_ptr, 
                                  UINT duid_type, 
                                  UINT hardware_type, ULONG time);
```

The application calls this service and specifies the type of DUID (link layer only, or link layer plus time. For link layer plus time DUIDs, this service will provide the time field if the time input is not specified.

For devices rebooting and wishing to use a previously assigned IPv6 address lease, the application must create the Client DUID as the one it used when assigned the IPv6 address. The link layer address is all that is needed to create a link layer Client DUID. This does not require previous non volatile memory storage if the device has access to the link layer address. For DUIDs of type time, the application must have access to the same time data used in the previous DUID creation and this does require non volatile memory. Clients that do not have any stable storage must not use DUIDs of type time.

### <span class="underline">Client Identity Association for Non Temporary Addresses (IANA)</span>

The application must create an IANA and optionally one or more IA addresses before requesting an IPv6 address. To do so, the application calls the *nx_dhcpv6_create_client_iana* service. To create an IA address option, the application calls the *nx_dhcpv6_add_client_ia* service with a requested IPv6 address and lifetime values as a hint to the Server.

The IANA and its IAs cumulatively define the Client IPv6 address assignment parameters:

Before starting the DHCPv6 Client, the DHCPv6 Client application creates an IANA using the *nx_dhcpv6_create_client_iana* service:

```C
UINT    nx_dhcpv6_create_client_iana(NX_DHCPV6 *dhcpv6_ptr, 
									 UINT IA_ident, ULONG T1, ULONG T2);
```

It must also create one or more IAs using the *nx_dhcpv6_create_client_ia* service and requested IPv6 addresses before starting the DHCPv6 Client.

```C
UINT    nx_dhcpv6_add_client_ia(NX_DHCPV6 *dhcpv6_ptr, 
                                NXD_ADDRESS *ipv6_address, 
                                ULONG preferred_lifetime, 
                                ULONG valid_lifetime);
```

> **Note:** The number of IA addresses the application creates cannot exceed the NX_DHCPV6_MAX_IA_ADDRESS parameter whose default value is 1.

The NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client supports *nx_dhcpv6_create_client_ia* for legacy DHCPv6 Client applications and which is identical to *nx_dhcpv6_add_client_ia* but developers are encouraged to use the *nx_dhcpv6_add_client_ia* service.

These services are demonstrated in the "Small Example System" elsewhere in this chapter.

### <span class="underline">Non Volatile Memory Considerations To Reuse IANAs and IAs</span>

The application must save IANA parameters T1, T2, and the IANA identifier to non volatile memory if it wishes to use the same address(es) on rebooting. The application must also save its IA which includes its IPv6 address to non volatile memory.

The application must also store the time elapsed that it has been bound to its assigned IPv6 address lease(s) to non volatile memory if shutting down. It does this by calling the *nx_dhcpv6_get_time_accrued* service before it stops the DHCPv6 Client.

```C
UINT nx_dhcpv6_get_time_accrued(NX_DHCPV6 *dhcpv6_ptr, 
                                ULONG *time_accrued);
```

Assuming the application has an independent clock to track the time interval from when it stopped and restarted the DHCPv6 Client after a reboot, it adds to that elapsed time to the time accrued on the IPv6 lease before stopping. It now starts the Client thread task with the total elapsed time bound to the IPv6 lease as the nv_time input below:

```C
UINT nx_dhcpv6_start(NX_DHCPV6 *dhcpv6_ptr, ULONG nv_time);
```

From this point, the DHCPv6 Client thread task will take over monitoring the time accrued on the IPv6 lease for when to renew the lease.

### <span class="underline">Setting DHCPv6 Option Data</span>

Before requesting an IPv6 lease, the application can request other network parameter data such as DNS server and time server. Some of these parameters have specific services. A few are shown below:

```C
UINT  nx_dhcpv6_request_option_DNS_server(NX_DHCPV6 *dhcpv6_ptr, 
                                          UINT enable)

UINT  nx_dhcpv6_request_option_time_server(NX_DHCPV6 *dhcpv6_ptr, 
                                           UINT enable);
```

### <span class="underline">Initiating the IPv6 address Request</span>

The application starts the DHCPv6 Client thread by calling the *nx_dhcpv6_start* service with a zero time input. To initiate the DHCPv6 protocol to request an IPv6 address, the application calls *nx_dhcpv6_request_solicit.*

If the application wishes to use a previously assigned IPv6 lease assigned, it calls *nx_dhcpv6_start* with a non zero time input. It should not call *nx_dhcpv6_request_solicit*.

Thereafter the application need do nothing more and the DHCPv6 Client will automatically monitor when it is time to renew or rebind an IPv6 address.

## Small Example System

An example of how easy it is to use the NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client is described in the small example below using a DHCPv6 Client and a virtual "RAM" driver. This demo assumes a device with only a single physical network interface.

*tx_application_define* creates packet pool for the DHCPv6 Client to send DHCPv6 messages. It also creates an application thread and IP instance. It then enables UDP and ICMP on IP in lines 130-148. Then the DHCPv6 Client is created with state change (*dhcpv6_state_change_notify* ) and server error (*dhcpv6_server_error_handler*) callback functions in line151.

In the Client thread entry function, *thread_client_entry*, the Client IP is set up with a link local address and enabled for IPv6 and ICMPv6 services on lines 202-217. Before starting the DHCPv6 Client, the application creates a Client DUID, an IANA option and an IA address option on lines219-303. The IA address option is optional if the Client wishes to request an IPv6 address and valid and preferred lifetimes from the Server. The Server may or may not grant the requested IPv6 address or lease times. The application may add more IA options (up to NX_DHCPV6_MAX_IA_ADDRESS) to be assigned multiple global addresses.

Lastly, the application sets various options to request network parameters in its messages to the DHCPv6 Server. The DHCPv6 Client task is started by calling *nx_dhcpv6_start* in line306, and the actual DHCPv6 protocol is started in the SOLICIT state with the call to *nx_dhcpv6_request_solicit* in line 317. The DHCPv6 Client then automatically handles the promotion of the Client state through the DHCPv6 protocol until it is bound to an address or an error occurs. During this time, the application waits for the protocol to complete, as well as the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to complete if the IP instance is configured for DAD (which is the default configuration).

After the tx_thread_sleep call, the application checks on the global parameters set in the state change callback to determine the success of both the DHCPv6 Client task to get assigned an IPv6 lease and if so, that the DAD check for uniqueness succeeded. This is done using the counters set up in the state change and server error callback functions. The application polls for non zero counts of address_not_assigned, address_expired and server_errors for failed address assignment. If the count of bound_addresses is non zero (at least one address successfully assigned), it checks for a non zero address_failed_dad for a failed DAD check. An explanation of the state change and server error callbacks follows:

The state change callback, *dhcpv6_state_change_notify*, the previous and current DHCPv6 Client state to determine if the Client received any valid Server responses:

  - *dhcpv6_state_change_notify* checks for transitions directly from SOLICIT to INIT and if so it increments a counter for the DHCPv6 Client receiving no responses from the Server.

Next *dhcpv6_state_change_notify* checks if the Client was assigned (bound) to one or more IPv6 addresses:

  - If the new state is BOUND, it increments a counter of addresses bound to the Client.
    
The *dhcpv6_state_change_notify* also checks for a failed DAD check:

  - If the state transitions from DECLINE to INIT, the DHCPv6 Client has failed DAD check on one of its assigned addresses and increments the count of failed address assignments.
    
The last check by *dhcpv6_state_change_notify* in this example is for a successfully assigned address that passed the DAD check to fail to be renewed or rebind:

  - If the state changes from REBIND to INIT, the Client did not get any responses to either its RENEW or REBIND requests and *dhcpv6_state_change_notify* increments its count of expired addresses.

The *dhcpv6_server_error_handler* if notified by the DHCPv6 Client task of an error status received from the Server increments the count of server errors.

Assuming all goes well, the application queries the DHCPv6 Client for address data including lease times. It gets a count of valid (successfully assigned) addresses by calling the *nx_dhcpv6_get_valid_ip_address_count* service and time to renew in the IANA (applies to all IA addresses assigned) by calling *nx_dhcpv6_get_iana_lease_time* on lines 372-392. It then queries the DHCPv6 Client for each of its IA options for IPv6 address and lease times by address index.

Some DHCPv6 Client services (*nx_dhcpv6_get_lease_time_data, nx_dhcpv6_get_IP_address*) do not require an address index as an input, and return DHCPv6 parameters for the primary Client global address. This is suitable for Clients with a single global IPv6 address when it calls *nx_dhcpv6_get_valid_ip_address_lease_time* in line 384.

The DHCPv6 Client configuration, NX_DHCPV6_CLIENT_RESTORE_STATE, t allows a system to restore a previously created DHCPv6 Client in Bound state between system reboots. Calling the *nx_dhcpv6_client_get_record* to get the DHCPv6 Client record between system reboots on line 434, calling the *nx_dhcpv6_client_restore_record* to store the DHCPv6 Client record after system power up on line 525.

The application then releases the assigned addresses using the *nx_dhcpv6_request_release* service in line 552. To restart the application stops the DHCPv6 Client with the *nx_dhcpv6_client_stop* service in line 567 and clears all IPv6 addresses registered with the IP instance that were configured through the DHCPv6 Client. It does this by calling *nx_dhcpv6_reinitialize* in line 578. Then it restarts the DHCPv6 Client task with *nx_dhcpv6_start* and *nx_dhcpv6_request_solicit* services as before.

The DHCPv6 Client is deleted with the call to *nx_dhcpv6_delete* in line626. Note that it does not delete th*e* packet pool it created for the DHCPv6 Client because this packet pool is also used by the IP instance. Otherwise it should delete the packet pool if it has no further use for it using the NetX Duo *nx_packet_pool_delete* service.
